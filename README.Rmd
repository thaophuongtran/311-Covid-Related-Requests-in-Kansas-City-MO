title: "Non-Emergency Responses in the 311 System During the Early Stage of the Pandemic: \n A Case Study of Kansas City"
output: github_document
---

**Abstract**

In response to the widespread of COVID-19, citizens sought information and support from their city governance through the 311 non-emergency service request system. Our analysis showed that the pandemic has led to a considerable decline in the aggregate number of 311 calls in Kansas City; however, “Public Safety”, “Public Health”, “Trash/Recycling”, “Parks & Recreation”, and “Property / Buildings / Construction” experienced substantial increase in call volume. In order to explore whether these changes are driven by covid-related service requests, we use the description text data and identify 2,379 requests related to the pandemic, accounting for 4.3 percent of all non-emergency requests in Kansas City between March and August of 2020. More than half of covid-related requests reported mask violations where people fail to wear masks or do not wear masks properly. Compared to non-covid-related requests, citizens were more likely to seek non-emergency services through phone and email and less likely to use the web as means of communication.  In addition, the majority of changes in “Public Safety” and “Public Health” request volumes were driven by these covid-related requests.
